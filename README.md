So, since I needed an addon to spawn the BiS pre-raid gear for testing balancing on my repack, I thought I would make an addon that runs the ".additem" and gives you all pre-raid BiS items by clicking a button.

This is the first ever addon I have created, so I thought, why not share it here with the community?

(YOU NEED TO BE A GM TO USE THIS ADDON)

HOW TO USE:

1: Place the addon inside your WoW Client interface/addons folder.
2: When in-game, use the command "/tool" to open the addon.
3: Click on whichever spec you want the items for, and it will add them instantly to your backpack( REMEMBER TO HAVE SPACE! ).


I hope this helps someone!
